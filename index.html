        <h1 id="h1d">In-game items</h1>
        <h3 id="h3a">Guns</h3>
        <p id="p4"><span id="span6">AR(AssaultAssault Rifle)</span>:Average base damage, high rate of fire plus abundant ammo and can attach many accessories make the AR series the most used in PUBG matches. M16A4 and MK47 Mutant are two AR weapons that do not have a continuous fire function, but only have a burst fire function. AR guns are also quite easy to find everywhere on the map, except Groza and AUG-A3 are two weapons in the airdrop box, QBZ is an exclusive weapon in Sanhok map and G36C is a map exclusive weapon. Vikendi.</p>
        <p id="p5">Some typical guns:AKM(7,62mm ammo);Groza(7,62mm ammo);M16A4(5,56mm ammo);SCAR-L(5,56mm ammo);M416(5,56mm ammo)</p>
        <p id="p4"><span id="span6">SR(sniper Rifle)</span>:Having huge single-target damage, being able to knock out enemies with 1 hit to the head are the reasons why SR captures a main slot in the player's backpack. The downside is that the amount of ammunition is quite limited, the loading time is long and the reload time is quite long. The SR lines appear on the map at a fairly low rate, except for the AWM and Lynx AMR, a gun with only 5 bullets by default, which is a weapon in the airdrop chest, and the Winchester 1894 is an exclusive weapon located in the airdrop box. in the map Miramar.</p>
        <p id="p5">Some typical guns:AWM(300. Magnum ammo);Kar98(7,62mm ammo)</p>
        <p id="p4"><span id="span6">DMR</span>:Is the weapon that gamers trust to choose as the second weapon in the backpack after the AR gun line. The single-target damage is quite good, the ability to shoot as far as the SR, can add accessories to make gamers very confident in using this gun. The downside is that the recoil is quite high and the amount of ammunition is quite low without accessories. DMR gun lines appear on the map at a relatively low rate, except for MK14EBR which is an airdrop weapon and QBU is an exclusive weapon in Sanhok map. </p>
        <p id="p5">Some typical guns:SKS(7,62mm ammo);Mini14(5,56mm ammo)</p>
        <p id="p4"><span id="span6">SMG</span>:Has small single-target damage, but in return has a very fast fire rate, can shock enemies in close range, but is quite useless when fighting at long range because it is only suitable for combat at close range. . SMG is very suitable when fighting in an area with many adjacent houses, but due to the fast discharge rate, it also runs out of ammo very quickly, so try to control the amount of bullets you shoot. All SMGs can be easily found anywhere on the map, except for the MP5K submachine gun which is an exclusive weapon in the Vikendi map.</p>
        <p id="p5">Some typical guns:UMP9(45ACP ammo);UZI(9mm ammo)</p>
        <p id="p4"><span id="span6">shotgun</span>:Similar to SMG, except with slower fire rate than SMG and less ammo. Shotgun can shock an enemy at close range and can even knock out enemies with full level 3 equipment if shot correctly. The downside is that it is useless at long range (beyond 80m) and the ammo is quite limited. Shotgun lines can be easily found everywhere on the map, except for the DBS shotgun which was the only shotgun weapon in the airdrop crate in patch 4.3. However, PUBG's 6.3 update has also officially removed the DBS shotgun from the airdrop box and appeared on the map with a rare rate.</p>
        <p id="p5">Some typical gunsS686;S12K;S1897</p>
        <p id="p4"><span id="span6">pistol</span>:Has small single-target damage and a rather slow rate of fire, suitable for close-range combat and in the early stages of the match, when no other weapon is found. All pistols are easy to find everywhere on the map, except Sawed-off Shotgun which only appears on Miramar map and Flare Gun also appears on the map but with a very rare rate. .</p>
        <p id="p5">Some typical guns:P92(9mm ammo);P1911(45ACP ammo)</p>
